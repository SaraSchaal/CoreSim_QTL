## The following plots were presented at ASN 2021

This first plot shows how inversion aid in adaptation under high gene flow scenarios. QTN effect size is small (0.002) and a higher QTN mutation rate of 1e-7:

Looking into the simulation where inversions aid in adaptation under a higher gene flow scenario. Parameters: mig = 0.25, QTN mu = 1e-7, 
Inv mu = 1e-3, QTN effect = 0.002, strength of selection = 0.75, environmental variance = 0
  
The following plot shows the average length of inversions split by the FST values of the inversions: top 10% inversion FST values, bottom 90% inversion FST values.

The following plot shows the average age of inversions split by the same FST values.
