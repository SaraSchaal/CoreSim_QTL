# Core set with independent linkage groups

- Saraâ€™s simulations - one sim using 50-70% of the memory on the cluster and taking 5-6 hours of time
- Aki compared to memory his sims use:
    - SLiM TSR sim:
    - Parameters: 100 pops, 10,000 inds. total, each genome 500,000 nts, 10 linkage groups, one allele in one linkage group, default simplification ratio
    - Time: Starting memory usage: 0.8867 Mb, Max memory usage: 818.59Mb, CPU time: 81 seconds
    - Instrument: MacOs 1.2 GHz, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
- Aki will help Sara look into running on the HPC at NU
