## Questions for Ben

1. We didn't think of this occurring when we set up the simulation, but inversions can overlap in their location if they arose in different individuals that each 
were lacking the other inversion. So individual 1 gets an inversion spanning position 3 to 300. Then individual 2 doesn't have this inversion in their genome, but 
instead have an inversion that spans 210 to 450. Theoretically, these two could make offspring together and have those two inversions in the same individual. This
is an interesting dynamic and we are thinking of just leaving it as is and quantify how often this happens.
