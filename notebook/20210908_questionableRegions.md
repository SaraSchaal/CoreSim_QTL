Under strong selection and an oligogenic architecture we see adaptation occur in the simulations with high gene flow (i.e., m = 0.25, 0.4). When I plot out the no-inversion control Manhattan plot for the simulation with m = 0.25, there appears to be either very weak islands forming or some sort of genome wide adaptation. The paired inversion simulation has only one or no adaptive inversions evolve across replicates which makes it hard to categorize as divergence by inversions in these simulations. 

When I plot out the no-inversion control Manhattan plot for the simulation with  m = 0.4, there is very very weak genome-wide divergence which is the same for the paired inversion simulations. No adaptive inversions evolve in this parameter space. 

Originally I wrote down no region for these because they didn't seem to belong to any very clear region. For m = 0.25, I would maybe lean towards weak islands and inversions as its region. For m = 0.4, I would probably say red diamond for genome-wide divergence in both the inversion sims and no-inversion control.
