# CoreSim_QTL

This file contains descriptions for three SLiM simulation scripts that are variants on a two population model looking at the effects of migration and selection on the evolution of local adaptation and the underlying genetic architecture. 

All models utilize tree sequencing (Kelleher et al. 2016) to record neutral mutations outside of the simulation which substationally increases computational time. All neutral mutation lines are commented out and marked with a TreeSeq to understand what is needed with and without tree sequencing.


## Independent QTN Model


# Description 

This model simulates completely independent QTNs and explores when local adaptation evolves and under what type of genetic architecture with different selection and migration regimes.  

# Genomic Map 

2000 QTNs equally spaced with no recombination between them 
Each genomic chunck is 1000 bases containing 500 bp neutral buffer on either size of a single QTN (500 bp one side & 499 bp other)
