* The "no_seed" inversion movie is interesting but is not replicable (the seed was never output)

* The VCF files are too large to deal with, so I subsampled 200 random individuals (which should give us on average ~ 100 per population) and an MAF of 0.01

`vcftools --vcf 3384725_InversionVCF.vcf --max-indv 200 --maf 0.05 --out 3384725_InversionVCF_200ind_MAF05 --recode --recode-INFO-all`

The `--recode --recode-INFO-all` tells it to output a vcf file AND keep all the information.

Sara and I need to discuss the MAF filter - we've talked about 0.01 but are using 0.05 for now

```
Parameters as interpreted:
	--vcf 3384725_InversionVCF.vcf
	--recode-INFO-all
	--maf 0.05
	--max-indv 200
	--out 3384725_InversionVCF_200ind_MAF05
	--recode

Filtering Individuals Randomly
After filtering, kept 200 out of 2000 Individuals

There are some slight discrepancies with the mut dataframe and the VCF file after filtering. The same number of mutations are not there, but it might just be sampling error.

The individual IDs in Slim do not match the IDs in the VCF file. I will assume they are in the same order


Clustering in heat map sucks. It's better to do your own hclust to order individuals.
