20190608 - delete dominance/effect size thoughts. Using Katie's recombination code

// dominance & effect size values
	domVals = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01);
	effSizeVals = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01); // normal distribution
	for(i in 1:nqtls){
		alpha = sample(effSizeVals, 1)
		scriptForQTLs = "if (runif(1) < 0.5) -alpha; else alpha;";
		initializeMutationType("m2", sample(domVals, 1) ,"s", scriptForQTLs);
